# Ear Trainer
## About
Ear Trainer is a web application supporting the training of the musical hearing. The developed solution is based on a web framework Vue.js and additional library Vuex. The project structure was created using vue CLI, and the operation of all program packages is based on the npm package manager. All data that the program uses is stored and shared via Firebase. The functionalities of the application have been divided into two modes â€“ train mode, which allows to familiarise with the issues and to memorise the knowledge by doing the exercises, and a test mode, in which the user can evaluate the current progress in learning by doing a test. At the current stage, the basic functionality of the application has been implemented, and a group of exercises at the basic level from the departments Intervals and Triads have been added to the database.
